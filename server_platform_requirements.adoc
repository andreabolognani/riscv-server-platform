== Server Platform Hardware Requirements

=== RISC-V SoC

A RISC-V server platform is based on a RISC-V SoC with RISC-V application processors.

| ID#      ^| Requirement
| HSOC_010  | The RISC-V SoC MUST comply to the Server SoC specification cite:[ServerSoC].
2+| _The Server SoC specification is still under construction. This specification should
    be updated once the specification versioning info is finalized._
| HSOC_020  | All peripherals that are intended for assignment to a VM or a user space device driver must be
PCIe devices or be compliant to rules for SoC-integrated PCIe devices (cite:[ServerSoC, Section 2.5.11).

=== Peripherals

| ID#       ^| Requirement
| HPER_010   | For remote-access and system engineering purposes, a fully 16550-compatible cite:[NS16550] UART MUST be implemented.
2+| _This is a stronger requirement than MNG_030 cite:[ServerSoC]. This specification does not provide guidance around how the UART is physically exposed, i.e. via RS232 signalling, USB, a BMC or other mechanism._
| HPER_020  a| The implemented UART MUST support:

              * Interrupt-driven operation using a wired interrupt.
              * Flow control.
              * Support 115200 baud operation.

| HPER_030   | If a USB controller is implemented, it MUST comply to XHCI 1.2 or later cite:[XHCI].
| HPER_040  a| Implemented XHCI controllers must:

              * Support 64-bit addressing (AC64 = '1').
              * Support a 4K PAGESIZE.

| HPER_050   | If a SATA controller is implemented, it must comply to AHCI 1.3.1 or later cite:[AHCI].
| HPER_060  a| Implemented AHCI controllers must:

             * Support 64-bit addressing (S64A = '1').
| HPER_070   | A battery-backed RTC or analogous timekeeping mechanism MUST be implemented.

== Server Platform Firmware Requirements

[width=100%]
[%header, cols="5,25"]
|===
| ID#      ^| Requirement
| FIRM_010  | The RISC-V SoC MUST comply to the BRS-I recipe described in the Boot and Runtime Service specification cite:[BRS].
2+| _The Boot and Runtime Services specification is still under construction. This specification should
    be updated once the specification versioning info is finalized._
| FIRM_020  | MUST include the ability to boot from disk (block) and network (PXE, HTTP) devices.
|===

== Server Platform Security Requirements

Security requirements straddle hardware and firmware.

TBD: it is expected the high-level RoT / boot flow requirements will come from the platform security spec.

|===
| ID#      ^| Requirement
| SEC_010  | MUST implement UEFI Secure Boot and Driver Signing (cite:[UEFI] Section 32)
| SEC_020  | MUST back the UEFI Authenticated Variables implementation with
             a mechanism that cannot be accessed or tampered by an unauthorized
             software or hardware agent.
| SEC_030  | MUST implement in-band firmare updates as per cite:[BRS].
| SEC_040  | Firmware update payloads must be digitally signed.
| SEC_050  | Firmware update signatures need to be validated before being applied.
| SEC_060  | It should not be possible to bypass secure boot, authentication or digital signature failures.

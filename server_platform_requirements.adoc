| ID#      ^| Requirement
| HSOC_010  | The RISC-V SoC MUST comply to the Server SoC specification cite:[ServerSoC].
2+| _The Server SoC specification is still under construction. This specification should
    be updated once the specification versioning info is finalized._
| HSOC_020  | All peripherals that are intended for assignment to a VM or a user space device driver must be
based on PCIe.

| ID#       ^| Requirement
| HPER_010   | For remote-access and system engineering purposes, a fully 16550-compatible cite:[NS16550] UART MUST be implemented.
2+| _This specification does not provide guidance around how the UART is physically exposed, i.e. via RS232 signalling or via a BMC._
| HPER_020  a| The implemented UART MUST support:

              * Interrupt-driven operation using a wired interrupt.
              * Flow control.

| HPER_030   | If a USB controller is implemented, it MUST comply to XHCI 1.2 or later cite:[XHCI].
| HPER_040  a| Implemented XHCI controllers must:

              * Support 64-bit addressing (AC64 = '1').
              * Support a 4K PAGESIZE.

| HPER_050   | If a SATA controller is implemented, it must comply to AHCI 1.3.1 or later cite:[AHCI].
| HPER_060  a| Implemented AHCI controllers must:

             * Support 64-bit addressing (S64A = '1').
